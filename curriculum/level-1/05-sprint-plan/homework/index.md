# Sprint 5 Homework

## 1. Send Slack Message

Send a message “Hello, I am starting my homework!” to the `#general` room on Slack.  Remember to ask for help if you are getting stuck.

## 2. Continue to work on your project

1. Make sure you have a header, footer, and navigation across all your pages
2. Add a `links.html` page that has links to other classmate's sites
3. Add a `resume.html` page that has information about your education and career

### Project requirements

* Use the `<img>` tag to display a picture of you.
* Link to the `about.html` page
* Begin to style your document using CSS in your `style.css` file.
* Add the `reset.css` file to the `styles` folder of your repo.
* Reference your [website sketch](../../modules/using-css-to-style-html) to add elements, such as a header or sidebar, to your website.

### About page requirements

* Link to `index.html` (Homepage)
* Write your "developer story". This is a paragraph or list of your experience with computers up to this point.

Commit all changes to your repo and **push your changes to GitHub**.

## 3. Self Learning

Spend some time learning on your own. You can use Google or YouTube or anything else that will help you learn. Try exploring a topic on HTML or CSS that you can share with the class!
